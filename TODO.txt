Write manual section about decoupling & partial shutdowns


Decoupling Ideas:

- start_decoupled returns DecoupledSubsystem that needs to be awaited otherwise errors would get lost
- decoupledSubsystem does not propagate errors up to the top, instead it catches errors and returns them from the future
- every handle needs three cancellationtokens: global, group, local
- refactor using interfaces where appropriate

- maybe don't mix external and internal interfaces

Thoughts from train:
    - await subs
    - remove subs after stop
    - stop toplevel when all finished
