- Think about smart ways to shut down partial subsystems
    - Return value of start()? With a shutdown_subsystem token?
    - Additional function in SubsystemHandle to shut down subsystem tree

Necessities for partial shutdown function:
- shut down all nested tasks
- wait until all nested tasks are shut down
    - waiting should be done by event variables that trigger as soon as
      the subsystem is finished. Can sadly NOT be done through the joinhandle.
- remove all nested tasks from the subtask tree (unless failed)

IMPORTANT: Make sure that we do not produce a memory leak.
(Did that already happen by storing putting a reference to the subsystem in the SubsystemHandle?)
